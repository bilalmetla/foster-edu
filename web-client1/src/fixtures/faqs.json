      "body": "Foster is a web app and can run effectively in any modern browser. For computers, you need a laptop or desktop computer with (at least) 4G of memory and a 2+ Ghz processor (any computer bought in the last three years should be fine), or any Chromebook with 4G of memory and a 1.5+ Ghz processor. For bandwidth, you must have at least 2.0 Mbits/second upstream and 2 Mbits/second downstream. To check bandwidth use, https://speedtest.net/. For browsers, we recommend Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox or Microsoft Edge. You can also use Safari on Mac OS X, but you will not be able to use the screen sharing feature. For audio, we strongly recommend using a headset. A headset will ensure that others can hear your voice clearly and you don’t cause echo or background noise for others. You do not need to buy an expensive one -- any basic headset with a built-in microphone will work. A laptop with a built-in webcam and microphone will be sufficient as well if you’re in a quiet area."

      "body": "“On-Demand tutoring” is when a student requires immediate help and needs to connect with a tutor without a prescheduled session. Tutors that have set their availability set may get on demand requests and they can choose to accept those requests or not. On Demand requests are paid with an additional 10% premium on top of the tutors currently set rate."
